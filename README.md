## 🚀 Introduction

An intelligent monitoring system that monitors the user's real time posture and provides subtle hints to the users if the user is found to be following bad ergonomic practices while using his computer.


## 🧐 The problem that this project solves

Daily, millions of people around the world use a computer, be it for work or for leisure purposes. Hours spent in front of a computer, and people don't realize how their poor posture during that time will cause back pain, dry eyes and various other health issues. Computer Ergonomics is the need of the hour with rising texting finger syndromes and many similar health issues. To counteract this, we developed an software that continuously monitors the user without being intrusive and monitors their eye blink rate, eye strain, distance of thier face from the screen, and their sitting posture - whether they are sitting erect or they are slouching. The software runs on the background and is powered by web technologies along with tensorflow.js and Electron that runs silently in the background and alerts the user in regular intervals to maintain his erect posture / blink more often / other such ergonomically good practices by monitoring the respective parameters in real time.
